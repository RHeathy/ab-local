		# While this is not a problem for normal dynasties that are
		# defined, the `Penndraigh` dynasty is an special dynasty
		# that should only appear when a mission is completed.
		#
		# So it must **NOT** be in the dynasty_names for Welsh as
		# there is a chance the dynasty will randomly spawn when
		# a random noble takes power, a heir is introduced, or
		# a pretender rebel of welsh culture spawns.
